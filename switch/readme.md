### GO- SWITCH

- In Go, switch is a conditional statement that allows you to test the value of a variable against multiple possible values.
- Switch statements express conditionals across many branches.

```
switch variable {
case value1:
	// code to be executed when variable matches value1
case value2:
	// code to be executed when variable matches value2
case value3:
	// code to be executed when variable matches value3
default:
	// code to be executed when variable does not match any of the values above
}
```
